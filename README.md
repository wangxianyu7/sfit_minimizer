# sfit_minimizer

<dl> sfit_minimizer is a gradient-type minimization algorithm known to work 
particularly well for point lens microlensing light curves. This algorithm 
generalizes Simpson's idea that a 1-D function is well
described by it first derivative (which can easily be solved
exactly) to several dimensions, i.e., the function is well
described by a tangent plane.  </dl>
